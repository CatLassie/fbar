- integration
- unit square geometry
- gauss sum formula
- log(n) runtime
- binary or hex representation
- closed form
- generating functions
- square root algorithm (also binary)
- offset (sum - floored_sum) is half of the input number (sometimes off by 1)

- calculate an approximation and then go brute force from there (like for 1005, do 1000 fast and 5 slow)
- whats the expected value for infinite? or expected value for probability dstributions?
- maybe O(n/log(n)) as in, some values dont need to be calculated explicitly (like every third is automatic?)
- string input, do computaiton per digit ? (log_10 time)

- approximation algorithm

- TRUNCATE SQUARE_ROOT(2) and see periods of repeating overflows
