Could be reduced to a TSP?

Graph is:
- fully connected
- asymmetric edges (arcs)
- no triangle inequality! (can happen: a->c >= a->b + b->c)
- negative weights
- with negative cycles

procedure:
- assuming there are no negative cycles
	- otherwise detect cycle and return all [0,1,2,3,4]
- TSP with triangle inequality violated (multiple same city visits) can be reduced to TSP (no re-visits)
	- recalculate all d(u,v) distances -> replace with shortest paths, use Dijkstra, Bellman-Form,
	Floyd-Warshall, SPFA, etc.
	- TRY JOHNSONS ALGORITHM!
- Solve TSP with budget, start + end point
	- TRY WITH PATH NOT JUST WEIGHTS (MARK NODES VISITED THROUGH SHORTEST PATH)
	- TRY BRANCH AND BOUND OR DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

- is 999 time limit a factor?
